#### Case Study:  How does a Bike-Share navigate Speedy Success?  
######    
***Data Analyst:*** Joe Szymczak-Parker  
***Client/Sponsor:*** Cyclistic Bike-Share  

***Background:***  
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.  

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

**Purpose:**  
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno, the Director of Marketing and my manager, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

**Moreno has set a clear goal:**  
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends

**Scope / Major Project Activities:**


* Members vs. Casual	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
* How to convert Casual Riders	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
* Digital Media tactics	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

**This project does not include:**  
1.) Moreno has assigned the Data Analyst to answer only the first      question:  How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes.  Thus, though the other questions are in scope for our company as a whole, it is out of scope for my work as a Data Analyst.
2.)  Because of this, this analysis will not include why casual riders would buy Cyclistic annual memberships.
3.)  Additionally, the focus of this analysis will not include how Cyclistic could use digital media to influence casual riders to become members.
